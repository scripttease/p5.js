Playing with Javascript and p5.js.

This site is built with Jekyll, and hosted on github pages.

* [p5.js API Reference](http://p5js.org/reference/)
* [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)


## Local Development

Install Ruby and Node.js, clone the repo, and cd into it.

```sh
# Install the deps
bundle install

# Run jekyll
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Now go to http://localhost:4000/p5.js/
```

That's it, hack away!
